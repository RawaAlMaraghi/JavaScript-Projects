# JavaScript-Projects

This course served as a practical introduction to core web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through hands-on projects like a Tic Tac Toe game, a calculator, and a pizza menu, I was able to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, gaining experience in building functional web applications.

The biggest takeaway was learning how to structure content with HTML, style it using CSS, and bring it to life with JavaScript. These skills are vital for creating interactive, responsive websites and form the basis of modern web development.

JavaScript stood out as a particularly important tool, enabling dynamic content, user interaction, and integration with APIs. It also sets the stage for learning frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.

What I enjoyed most was the process of creating and refining applicationsâ€”debugging, solving problems, and seeing the results on screen. This course provided a strong, practical foundation to build upon in my journey as a developer.
